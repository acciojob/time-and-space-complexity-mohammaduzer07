	<h1>Time & Space Complexity in Data Structure and Algorithm</h1>
	<p>Time complexity plays an important role that describe the time to execute an algorithm in an efficient. way</p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm with respect to the input size suppose O(n). space</p>
	<p>Because a program requires memory to store input data and temporal values while running, the <b>Space Complexity</b> is auxiliary and input space</p>
