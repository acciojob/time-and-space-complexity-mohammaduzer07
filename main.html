	<header><h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1></header>
	<p>Time complexity plays an important role that describe the time to execute an algorithm. Therefore as a developer out goal is to reduce the time complexity by optimize it that will make our program more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity:</b> Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm with respect to the input size . Because a program requires memory to store input data and temporary values while running, if the program is taking our input size only, then the space complexity will be O(n).</p>
